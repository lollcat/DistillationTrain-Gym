## Abstract
This paper demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to process synthesis by
presenting Distillation Gym, a set of RL environments in which an RL agent is tasked with designing
a distillation train, given a user defined multi-component feed stream. Distillation Gym interfaces
with a process simulator (COCO and ChemSep) to simulate the environment. A demonstration of two
distillation problem examples are discussed in this paper (a Benzene, Toluene, P-xylene separation
problem and a hydrocarbon separation problem), in which a deep RL agent is successfully able to
learn within Distillation Gym to produce reasonable designs. Finally, this paper proposes the creation
of Chemical Engineering Gym, an all-purpose reinforcement learning software toolkit for chemical
engineering process synthesis.
 
 ## Agents
  - Soft Actor Critic (SAC) - this is the main agent that was used
  - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
 
## Example Problems
Distillation-Gym can be applied to any initial starting stream component selection and composition. The following examples are given:
### Benzene Toluene p-Xylene (taken from [ChemSep Examples](http://www.chemsep.org/downloads/index.html))

 ### Hydrocarbon Distillation
Agent is able to design sequence that achieves much higher revenue (through good recovery) than cost

 ## About this Repo
 The important folders are:
  - Env: Contains the RL environment (where python and COCO simulator speak using the COM interface)
  - SAC: The main agent
  - Utils: Some useful extra stuff (e.g. BFD generator)\

The other folders and files are just playing around with some other stuff (e.g. DDPG agent)\
See [requirements.txt](../Feature-double_done/requirements.txt) for required packages\
Both COCO and ChemSep need to be installed: To install these go to https://www.cocosimulator.org/index_download.html
